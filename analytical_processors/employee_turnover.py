        #Outcome of the Distributions:
# Employee Satisfaction (satisfaction_level)
# The distribution is bimodal, with peaks at low (around 0.1) and high (around 0.7-0.8) satisfaction levels.
# This suggests that employees tend to be either very satisfied or very dissatisfied.

# Employee Evaluation (last_evaluation)
# The distribution shows peaks around 0.5 and 0.85-1.0.
# This suggests two groups: moderate performers and highly evaluated employees.

# Employee Average Monthly Hours (average_monthly_hours)
# The distribution is right-skewed, with peaks around 150-200 and 250+ hours.
# This suggests two work-hour groups: regular workers and overworked employees.
